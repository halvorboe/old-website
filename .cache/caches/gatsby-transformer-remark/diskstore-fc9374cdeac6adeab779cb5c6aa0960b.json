  "val": "<p>Bigtable is a distributed storage system developed internally by Google to handle petabyte-scale applications - like Google Maps and Google Analytics. In 2015 Bigtable was launched as a public service on Google Cloud.</p>\n<p>Similar to many other datastores, Bigtable uses a structure of rows and columns. Where it differs is in that Bigtable only allows for a single index - the row-key. Three primary operations exist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mutate</strong> - used to change the value connected to a row key and also for inserts.</li>\n<li><strong>Read</strong> - read the value of a single row key.</li>\n<li><strong>Range</strong> - read a range of row keys. Both filtering and aggregations are supported.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To achieve scaling, Bigtable splits the data into <em>nodes</em>. Each <em>node</em> is a commodity server and stores a range of row keys. As a result, choosing the right key for your workload is crucial.</p>\n<p>For example, consider the example of storing a marketing event in Bigtable. The event looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"id\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"15d1369c-934e-11ea-bb37-0242ac130002\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"timestamp\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">1000</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"url\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://www.example.com/about\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>There are three types of data here:</p>\n<h2>Random</h2>\n<p>The row key is random. Random data should not be the beginning if a low key in Bigquery because it makes range queries useless.</p>\n<h2>Timestamp</h2>\n<p>The timestamp for the example is a long time ago, but when dealing with timestamps, it is essential to get them in the right format.</p>\n<p>2019#12#03#14:05:12</p>\n<h2>URL</h2>\n<p>We are reversing the most common.</p>\n<p>In summary, Bigtable is a great datastore - if you are storing massive amounts of data. Otherwise, itâ€™s terrible.</p>"
