Three primary operations exist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mutate</strong> - used to change the value connected to a row key and also for inserts.</li>\n<li><strong>Read</strong> - read the value of a single row key.</li>\n<li><strong>Range</strong> - read a range of row keys. Both filtering and aggregations are supported.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To achieve scaling, Bigtable splits the data into <em>nodes</em>.
