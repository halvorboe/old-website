In the case of this blog,\nI would like to know if anyone is reading my posts. A lot of great\nsolutions already exist. The most popular one is <em>Google Analytics</em>.\nTheir ‘free’ offering will work perfectly for most people and is used by\nmost sites you visit.</p>\n<p>I don’t like the business model of <em>Google Analytics</em>. It exists to\nserve advertisers - so it tries to collect as much information as\npossible. Also, not all of that information is exposed to the entity\nrunning the site. For example, there is no way to export all data\ncollected by <em>Google Analytics</em>. That means that at some point you will\nhave to opt into their <em>Google Analytics 360</em> plan - which offers deeper\ninsights but is way to expensive for most people/companies.</p>\n<p>So I decided to create my own “Google Analytics” - <strong>with a focus on\nprivacy</strong>.</p>\n<h2>But wait… have you considered other options?</h2>\n<p>“Google Analytics” is far from the only analytics platform out there.\nSome of the ones I have considered are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heap Analytic</li>\n<li>Amplitude</li>\n<li>Simple Analytics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just to be clear, I do not think this solution will be better than any\nof those. The main purpose of this solution is killing time and having\nsomething to write about.</p>\n<h2>So what is an analytics platform?</h2>\n<p>To me, an analytics platform is <strong>a system for aggregating events</strong>. In\nthat defenition there are two main words that need explaination -\n<strong>event</strong> and <strong>aggregation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let’s start by looking at what I mean by an <strong>event</strong>. An event in this\ncontext can be any action the user is doing on the site - loading the\npage, clicking a button, hovering the mouse over an element… You get the\npoint. In code, that event could look something like:</p>\n<p>These events will be generated while the user is visiting the site\nthrought a tracking script. This tracking script will send events back\nto the server. The server will recieve an event that looks something\nlike this:</p>\n<p>The amount of these events varey. Some trackers track every mouse\nmovement, while other trackers only track when a user enters a site. If\nthere are a lot of these events there is no longer a point to looking at\nsingle events. We need to get the bigger picture.</p>\n<p>This is where aggregations come in. Let’s say we have 1000 of the events\nabove. Possible insights could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What browsers are the users using?</li>\n<li>How many pages does the average user visit?</li>\n<li>How long does the average user stay on the site?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To answer these questions we need to do aggregations. Aggregations in\nsimple terms is calculating something based on a set of events. If you\nare familiar with functional programming, most aggregations can be\nformulated as a reduce step. Something like:</p>\n<p>Doing these aggregations and letting the user query them is the main job\nof an analytics platform.</p>\n<h2>I understand, but where does Gallop come in?</h2>\n<p>Gallop is not a analytics platform, or at least that is not the goal.\nThe main goal of Gallop is to create a simple API where user submitted\nevents can be processed and insights generated.</p>\n<p>I want to be able to build a dashboard on top of that GraphQL API that\ncan show staticsics of the people visiting my site.</p>\n<p>So events generated when people visit the different pages on my site\nwill be collected and aggregated with an indexer. This indexer will put\nthe events into an index where they can be easily queried.</p>\n<p>I will write more blog posts about the different aspects of the\nprojects. The next one will be about the GraphQL API.</p>\n<h2>Sounds cool. What will the finnished project look like?</h2>\n<p>Except from the fact that the project probably will never be finnished.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>There will be a dashboard on this site where users can see how many</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>people have visited the site. There will also be analytics on a\nper article level. Hopefully this can be added to the statis site\ngeneror.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>",
