Where it differs is in that Bigtable only allows for a single\nindex - the row-key. Three primary operations exist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mutate</strong> - used to change the value connected to a row key and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>also for inserts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Read</strong> - read the value of a single row key.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Range</strong> - read a range of row keys. Both filtering and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>aggregations are supported.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To achieve scaling, Bigtable splits the data into <em>nodes</em>. Each <em>node</em>\nis a commodity server and stores a range of row keys.</p>",
