For a long time, the only way to get a SQL database was paying tons of money for a licence. Two databases prevailed as the winners of that aera - MSSQL and Oracle Database. Recently, a new generation of open-source SQL databases have taken over. Most young companies use an open-source database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.</p>\n<p>MySQL and Postgres are very simular - at least that is my perception. I’ve looked into the differences between them before, and I wanted to collect my findings in an article.</p>\n<h3>So what are the differences?</h3>\n<p>History is a good place to start. Postgres and MySQL where released at about the same time - 25 years ago - with an open-source licence. But their origins are quite different.</p>\n<p>Postgres came out of <em>UC Berkeley</em>, where development started in 1985. Papers where published and versions were released. In 1994 the project ended and the code was released under a modified MIT licensce.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Funfact</strong>: the project was based on a previous project named ’<em>ingres</em>’, so they named it ’<em>postgres</em>‘.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Origionally, postgres did not use SQL. It used a laguage based on the previous project (ingres). This changed in 1994, when a new SQL front-end was developed. The named was changed to PostgreSQL in 1996 to reflect the change.</p>\n<p>Development has continued, but everything has been open-source from then.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/51b21ea97555b440904b85979c526d08/e1596/001.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Postgres team\"\n        title=\"Postgres team\"\n        src=\"/static/51b21ea97555b440904b85979c526d08/1c72d/001.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/51b21ea97555b440904b85979c526d08/a80bd/001.jpg 148w,\n/static/51b21ea97555b440904b85979c526d08/1c91a/001.jpg 295w,\n/static/51b21ea97555b440904b85979c526d08/1c72d/001.jpg 590w,\n/static/51b21ea97555b440904b85979c526d08/a8a14/001.jpg 885w,\n/static/51b21ea97555b440904b85979c526d08/fbd2c/001.jpg 1180w,\n/static/51b21ea97555b440904b85979c526d08/e1596/001.jpg 2048w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Image above: <em>Postgres Professional development team as of 2017</em></p>\n<p>In summary, Postgres comes from the research world. Later it became an open-source project.</p>\n<p>MySQL on the other hand stems from <em>MySQL AB</em>. <em>MySQL AB</em> was a swedish company that existed until Oracle killed it… Ok - maybe Oracle didn’t kill it, but it did buy it for $1B in 2010. It has two versions - one for open source and one for enterprise. There is also an open source fork named <em>MarinaDB</em>.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<!-- Write more about MySQL history -->\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th>MySQL</th>\n<th>Postgres</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>SQL</td>\n<td>1985</td>\n<td>1996</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Postgres only features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Geographic support.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>MySQL only features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Geographic support.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>I understand, but what are the communities like now?</h3>\n<h3>But there must be some performance differences, right?</h3>\n<h3>Why is the performance different?</h3>\n<h3>I’ve made my pick, how do I host it?</h3>\n<h2>So which one is better?</h2>",
