A handful of times in the last five years, I&#39;ve tried to start a blog - and consecutively failed. With &quot;_Complex Codes_&quot; the trend is hopefully going to change. When writing this, the hope is that it will help me reflect and actually make a change.

## Why did I fail before?

Implementing new habits is hard. Research has shown that it takes around a month for a pattern to become a habit. In other words, committing to a new habit is useless if you cannot keep repeating the pattern for a month.

Therefore, committing to blogging every week for a month is the basis for this blog. More specificly I&#39;ve commited to writing an article a week, and spending some time every day writing. Hopefully that will be enought for the habit to stick.

Research has also shown that commiting publiclly in a way where failiure is humiliating helps. When I say research has hw

Another reason for mye previous failiues was the fact that I did not get any feedback on the work I was doing. Feedback is crucial to improve and feel that you are learning. Constructive feedback is encuraging as well as positive feedback.

Grammarly is a great tool for getting feedback instantly.

The last reason for failiure was that I had no idea how to write. Meaning that I did not have a process for writing. I&#39;m used to writing software. There I have a clear process.

In summary, the reason why I failed was that I did not publicly commit so following a process. So now it makes sense to publih the process and commit to it.

## So what is this magical process?

I&#39;m glad you asked. A lot of research has gone into finding a process that might work.

It started with Google&#39;s course on technical writing (link). From that course I got a lot of good tips on how to make your writing more coheirant.

Another source was a book on technical writing. All of them say the same thing, which is:

1. Collect the information.
2. Write a draft.
3.
4. Profit!

With this beeing a more casual and personal blog that became a bit too strict. A lot of my posts will be about random stuff I&#39;m working on - because that is what I like to write about.

_Ninja Writing Course_ (link) has been a great help in the process of writing.

I&#39;ve also been trying to find books on how to write better.

Here is the process I&#39;ve come up with:

### 1: Collecting ideas

The first step is finding stuff to write about. I have many sources of inspiration. I&#39;m currently in the process of starting a software company, so there are a lot of ideas stemming from that. There are also a lot of ideas comming from other places.

### 2: Curate and organize ideas

This is where I&#39;ve been really bad before. The idea behind this post is to explain my writing process.

### 3: Develop the ideas

This is where the actual writing comes in.

1. Create a mindmap
2. Extract structure from the mindmap
3. Fill in the gaps
4. Revise
5. Profit!

### 4: Profit!

Publish the article to _Complex Codes_.

That is my process. If you are reading this article the process worked :D

## I&#39;m confused, what is this blog then? An experiment?

This blog is whatever I want it to be. I want to focus on technical topics, because that is what I&#39;m most passionate about.

The blog is for software engineers. I&#39;m a software Engineer myself, so the blog is written for an alternative self. But here are the topics an alternative self would be interested in:

### Topics I want to cover:

- Databases
- Software engineering
- User interactions
- Projects

If you find this blog useful, that would be really cool.

## This seems like a struggle for you. Why all the drama?

There are three main reasons:

Firstly, I want to get better at writing.

Secondly, I want to be able to communicate more efficiently.

Thirdly, this would be a cool side-hustle.
