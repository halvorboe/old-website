Getting humans to agree on what's right or wrong is really hard. Making machines agree is should be much easier - in theory. That is until you realize that a machine can die at any time, can loose its ability to speak and so on. In this blog post I'll go throught the paper called "Paxos vs Raft: Have we reached consensus on distributed consensus?" and try to explain what the different algorithms do.

Paper 

Abstract
- Consensus is critical 
- Two main algorithms 
    - Paxos
    - Raft
- Raft is simpler 

Introduction 
- State machine replication 
    - Paxos is the defecto algorithm -> hard to understand
- Raft is simpler whilst being as efficient
- Reft 
    - Presentation
        - Pragmatic
    - Simplicity 
        - Simlicity over performance 
    - Underlying algorithm
        - Novel approach to lear election
- Paxos is a family of algorithms 
    - Chubby 
- No difference in understandability
